# Rules of Vavity

- **The autonomous system handles the rules, not humans.**

## Vavity's Autonomous Protections

We don't control the environment, alter the system or introduce volatility thus our panic doesn't affect others.

Our only contribution is: **deciding whether to enter or wait.**

Once inside, the system protects us from our own worst instincts by removing:

- loss realization
- fight-or-flight pressures

This makes Vavity:

- non-manipulable
- non-inflationary
- non-extractive

## Anchored Upward Limit

prevents:

- price hyperinflation
- runaway psychological valuation
- unbounded optimism or mania

## Self-Limiting

- Price cannot exceed external reference
- Price cannot fall below imports/purchases
- There is no mechanic that encourages runaway behavior (price hyper-inflation)

## Why Previous Bear Market Obfuscating Financial Architectures Failed

Every failed monetary invention created to eliminate (or limit) investment losses was human dependent:

- human trust → issuance → risk
- human hype → exposure → greater collapse potential

Vavity is:

- **autonomous** — technology enforces the rules, not human judgment
- **bounded** — prices cannot exceed external reference or fall below imports
- **self-limiting** — no endogenous loops that spiral out of control
- **non-manipulable** — irrational behavior cannot damage the architecture
