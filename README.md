## VAVITY

**An autonomous financial system that protects our investments from bear market losses.**

- This is accomplished by anchoring asset prices before they fall.

Bear markets are a human psychology issue, so Vavity solves loss aversion psychologically through technical autonomy. By eliminating bear markets within its financial system, Vavity introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:

- **Solid Marketplace:** a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase.
- **Sloth Market:** a market in which investments stagnate.

Just like the invention of clocks and calendars, Vavity is both a psychological and technological invention.
