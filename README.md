## VAVITY

**An autonomous financial system that anchors asset prices before they fall.**

- This is accomplished by removing human psychology out of financial systems.

By eliminating bear markets, Vavity introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:

- **Solid Marketplace:** a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase.
- **Sloth Market:** a market in which investments stagnate.
