## VAVITY

**An autonomous financial system that anchors asset prices before they fall.**

- This is accomplished by removing human psychology from financial systems.

Bear markets are a human psychology issue, not a technical issue, so Vavity solves loss aversion psychologically through technical autonomy. By eliminating bear markets, Vavity introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:

- **Solid Marketplace:** a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase.
- **Sloth Market:** a market in which investments stagnate.

Just like the invention of clocks and calendars, Vavity is both a psychological and technological invention.
