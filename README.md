## VAVITY

**An autonomous pricing system that anchors asset prices before they fall.**

Investment losses are a human psychology issue, so Vavity solves this issue psychologically through technical autonomy. By eliminating investment losses within its financial system, Vavity introduces a new kind of marketplace and market dynamics:

- **Solid Marketplace:** a marketplace in which investments either stagnate or increase.
- **Sloth Market:** a market in which investments stagnate.

Just like the invention of clocks and calendars, Vavity is both a psychological and technological invention.
